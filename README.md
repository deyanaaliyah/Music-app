## Music app
A __Java console__ music playing application

This project is made for a school project at KEA. It shows the different design patterns of MVC.

It features:
1. A repository of five songs inside the project
* it is possible to add new songs, both hard coded and via typing "-2" in the console
2. Notifications everytime you change songs
* it will tell you a timestamp
* it is unfortunately not possible to actually hear a song (due to copyrights)
3. Notes throughout the project
* to show *you* what the specific LOC (lines of code) means
